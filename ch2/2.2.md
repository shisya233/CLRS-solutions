### 2.2.2

SELECTION-SORT(A)
​	for i=1 to A.length-1
​		for j=i+1 to A.length
​			if A[i] > A[j]
​				tmp = A[i]
​				A[i] = A[j]
​				A[j] = A[i]

loop invariant:

A[1..i] is sorted and elements in A[1..i] all smaller than A[i+1..n]

Initialization:

A[1] is the smallest element in A, and it's sorted.

Maintenance:

before this iteration, A[1..i-1] is sorted and smaller than A[i..n], after this iteration, A[i] is the smallest element in A[i..n] and it's bigger than A[i-1], so A[1..i] is sorted and elements in A[1..i] all smaller than A[i+1..n]

Termination:

after the last iteration, A[i..n-1] is sorted and A[n] is bigger than each element of A[1..n-1], so A is sorted.
